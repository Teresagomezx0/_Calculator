Calculator project built with Javascript

This calculator is fully responsive for tablets, phones, and desktops. Its functionality is implemented by clicking on the number buttons followed by any operation button, then the equals button. This will display the answer.

There is also a clear button (AC) and a backspace button (DEL). The clear button can be pressed at any time to clear the Calculator. The delete button will simply delete the last number entered.
